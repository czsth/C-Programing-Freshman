# C-Programing-Freshman

This is the repository to store those assignments in the class of C-Programming for us freshmen.

Currently there are two folder, `Homework` and `Experiment`. Thought I don't think there are any differences between them.

`.c` files only.

Codes after 2018-5-4 only, for there were a lot of Chinese comments in GB-code in former ones.

The textbook is: *C语言与程序设计（曹计昌   卢萍  李开  编著）*
